# Hello, Cargo!

Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. (eg npm equivalent of JavaScript)

Commands

```
$ cargo --version
$ cargo new hello_cargo
```

Cargo.toml

- This file is generated by `cargo new` and this is where all the dependencies are listed

```
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

```

## Building and running a cargo project

1. `cargo build`

- This creates an executable file in `target/debug/hello_cargo`

```
$ cargo build
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
> Hello, world!
```

2. `cargo run`

- This builds and run a project in one step

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
```

3. `cargo check`

- This quickly checks the code to make sure it compiles, but doesn't produce an executable
- It is much faster than `cargo build` because it skips the step of producing an executable

```
$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
```
